# Client Analytics Dashboard

This project provides an interactive dashboard to visualize client activity on a website, with a focus on geographic distribution and visit dynamics over time.

##  Key Features

- **Client Distribution by Country:** A pie chart shows how website visitors are distributed across selected countries for a chosen month.
- **Client Visit Activity:** A line chart displays how the number of client visits changes daily for each country during the selected month.
- **Interactive Filters:** Dropdowns allow users to select a specific month and one or more countries. The charts automatically update based on these selections.

##  Purpose

The dashboard is intended to help understand:
- Which countries generate the most traffic.
- How client activity varies over time.
- Market reach and audience behavior per region.

 **Note:** This dashboard does **not** include revenue or monetary data (e.g., no "Target" field). It is focused purely on visit-based analytics.

## Final Output

The expected final output for this project includes:

* A Python script.
* A 46-second video (screen recording) demonstrating the functionality of the visualization.

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
